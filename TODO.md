# TODO

- Refactor main and openai files - very much needed
- Fix keypresses when capslock is active
- UX ideas / improvements
- More providers?
- Replace Robot JS with something lighter
  - Debating adding mac specific keyboard support using Swift or AppleScript, to avoid NPM dependencies here (experience so far has not been great)
- Fix issue with auto typing sometimes being detected as user typing - this may be resolved with sleep added before ignore variable reset
- Express server for chat interface?
- Accept custom tool definitions
- Add anthropic
- Find solution for hack to import chat functions based on provider
- Gemini tool usage
